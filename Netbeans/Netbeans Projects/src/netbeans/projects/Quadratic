/*
You are going to write a program that helps students with some grade 10 math work. 

Consider a quadratic in standard form to be f(x) = Ax2 + Bx + C

Design and create a quadratic class that can be used to display the following information about a quadratic to the user

The direction of opening
The vertex
The y intercept
The zeros of the quadratic
The Vertex Form of the Equation
Write a program that uses that quadratic class to display all of that relevant information to a grade 10 math student.  The program should let the student enter as many quadratics as they want.

Use Netbeans to create the program and email me the .java files.  No time limit for this.  I will wait to mark it until I get the java files sent to my email.
