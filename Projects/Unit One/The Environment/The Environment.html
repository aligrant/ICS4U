          The many advances in the technology industry are the cause of both many problems and betterments for the environment. 
          When considering digital technology, such as computers and phones, their popularity has increased the demand for energy, 
          changed how we communicate and interact with each other, and created an entirely new layer to everyday life. 
          These changes have many sub-problems that require further exploration in order to develop a full understanding of the implications of technology. 
          Although technology has negative impacts on the environment, 
          it also allows for more education and research which can help to minimize these impacts [1]. 
          By providing information on the problems associated with technology, as well as the solutions, 
          this website is an example of how technology can be used to protect our environment.</p>

          <p>In the <b>Problem</b> tab, a few of the many impacts that technology has on the environment and human health are discussed: the consumption of energy,
            waste management, and computer-related physical health issues.</p>

          <p>The <b>Statistics</b> tab presents data relating to the issues discussed in the problems tab. 
             These help to visualize the severity of what we are dealing with.</p>

          <p> The <b>Initiatives</b> tab explains what is being done by the government and other organizations to prevent
              and solve the issues that technology has caused.</p>

          <p>The <b>Act Now</b> tab suggests different ways that humans can help prevent the issues associated with technology.</p>

          <p>The <b>References</b> tab provides a list of the works referenced throughout the site in IEEE format.</p>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <div id="problem" class="col s12" style="display: none;"><h4>The Problem</h4>
          <h5>Energy Consumption</h5>
            The acceleration of digitalization has led to higher demands for energy [1]. 
            Accordingly, this has increased carbon emissions and the depletion of natural resources [1]. 
            
          <h5>Waste Management</h5>
            The materials needed for digital devices are mined by using harmful chemicals such as mercury [2]. 
            These chemicals are then dumped into the ground, polluting the environment and affecting the health of the people living nearby. 
             Additionally, many people incorrectly dispose of their digital devices and their components. 
             This further harms the environment and poses a health risk [2]. 
            
          <h5>Physical Health</h5>
            Many jobs require people to use computers for extended periods of time, 
            especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor working environments and 
            unergonomic conditions can lead to bad posture, muscle strain, and tendon injuries [3].

            <li>Locate a technology and battery waste management facility to dispose of your devices

            <li>Limit the number of unnecessary emails you send. This can be made easier by downloading chrome extensions

            <li>To minimise the carbon footprint of a website, ensure that the code is written efficiently, 
          the fonts are web-safe, the host of the site uses renewable energy, and minimise the number of page-loads required [4].</li> 
           
            <li>Advocate for cleaner methods of energy, and influence governments.
